## Description of project 😎

<p>Recently I'm studying python and I really want to focus on this language, I studied a little with the documentation I'm in module 5 and to put the knowledge into practice I created this project which is the closest to the cat command.</p>

## Running the project 🚀

<p>To run the project it is necessary to leave the filename as `catpy` and add its path to your global $PATH</p>
